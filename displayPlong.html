        <h2>displaying plong</h2>
        <div class="bubble">
            Before building the screen where plong will be displayed upon, we should look into possible user criteria. The following criteria displayed here are the criteria we look out for.
        </div>
        <div id="pcScreen">
            <!--pc screen-->
            <div>
                <!--content container-->

                <div>
                    <!--text container-->
                    <div>
                        
                        <p class="bold">
                            []Viewing angle 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the best experience, we must keep the viewing angle in mind. The screen will be laid on the surface of the Dommel. 
                            There should be enough height for the players to be able to look over the screen. By that we mean that the ball should be visible from one bank to the other.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p class="bold">
                            []size of the screen
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The size of the screen should be of such size that the player can see the screen clearly. To small, and it might be hard to follow the game. 
                            But make it too big, and it very difficult to have a good overview. We should thus keep this in mind when deciding on the screen.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p class="bold">
                            []Pixel density
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pixel density is also something to keep in mind when deciding the specifications. While having too many pixels isn’t a problem for user experience, 
                            having too little pixels is. Power management will struggle however if the pixel count gets too high. We should aim for the golden middle.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p class="bold">
                            []Fluidity of the screen
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We should also keep the refresh rate of the screen in mind. This so that game doesn’t feel like it stutters. 
                            The original had quite a smooth refresh rate for the date it came out. We should aim for the game being like that, or around that.
                        </p>
